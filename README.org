* Introduction

This is a conversion of the [[https://yearcompass.com/][year compass booklet]] into a text based markup that allows several possibilities. For one thing, the text based format allows a version control, and it becomes possible to use your favorite text editor to fill in the details. For verbose material like this, such considerations become important. This approach also makes it possible to deploy the content onto a webpage that can always be accessible for reference, or a blog post etc.

The template is stored in the org file [[file:template.org][template.org]]. In my case, the actual content for each year will be stored in the Readme. I maintain my information in a private repository.
